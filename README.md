TASK 1
MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. The Data used in the task is taken from kaggle as the link is provided by CodeSoft



Task 2
detect fraudulent credit card transactionsBuild a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use adataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent orlegitimate.


Task 3

Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Use historical customer data, includingfeatures like usage behavior and customer demographics, and tryalgorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or GradientBoosting to predict churn.
